## The Journey:

The Journey so far has been challenging and fun at the same time for me this was my `4th project` and `2nd project on React` the deadline was just a week, it all felt like i was  working on a real product, and also i tried to enact the overall activity as the real working climate where i used git commands to collaborate with my I.A throughout the project. The planning, discussions, and other team-relevant activities were done via zoom meetings.
